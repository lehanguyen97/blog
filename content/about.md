I'm a student of FETEL HCMUS. This site is just a place where I can sumarize my experience.
The main subject of this blog besides my rant will be about electronic, coding and neural network.
Hopefully I'll have the motivation for this.

About the site: I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate this site, my page's theme is [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even).

Many thanks to Github, Hugo, and olOwOlo (Even theme dev) for making this blog come to life.
